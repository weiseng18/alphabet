<p>This game revolves around the <strong>printer</strong>. Taking in paper and ink, using electricity from your brain, it prints a English <strong>word</strong> from your vocabulary.</p>

<h3>Word</h3>
<p>It can be subjective, whether a word is belongs to English, and whether it is even a word. In this game, only words from <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/twl06/download/twl06.txt" target="_blank">this list</a> are deemed as valid English words for the game.</p>

<p>Every word is made up of <strong>letters</strong>. In order for the word to possibly be part of your vocabulary, you need to know all of the letters that make up the word. How else would you be able to commit the word to memory?</p>

<p>Additionally, knowing all the letters that make up a word isn't enough for the word to be committed to your memory. If it were, then everyone who knows the alphabet should be able to list every single word in the English language. But they can't. You will need to <strong>discover</strong> the word to implant it into your vocabulary.</p>

<p>Somehow you're able to read this though.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>A letter is one of "a-z" in the English alphabet. You don't really have a concept of alphabet, so you need to depend on others to identify symbols that appear to be part of the alphabet. In short, you pay your shady dealer some bucks to <strong>discover</strong> a new letter.</p>

<h3>Printer</h3>
<p>Your consciousness is connected to the printer. Once you have some vocabulary, and sufficient paper and ink, it prints a random word from your vocabulary, purely by instinct.</p>
<p>The printer isn't that good however, as it can't print concisely. At the current state, it can only print 1 letter per piece of paper. A word doesn't count as a word if you print each letter on a separate piece of paper. So you're only able to print 1-letter words now. The printer is an extension of yourself, so you're not able to visualize words that are longer than 1 letter, and as such you do not have the capacity to put such words into your vocabulary</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that printing a word earns you some money, which can be used to pay your shady dealer, or to upgrade the printer. Classic incremental game gameplay. Or you can form a stronger bond with the printer, so that even the printer can discover new words for you.</p>

<h3>Revenue</h3>
<p>The revenue system works the same way as Scrabble awards points.</p>
<table style="text-align:center;">
	<tr>
		<th>Revenue</th>
		<th>Letter(s)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$1</td>
		<td>A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, U</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$2</td>
		<td>D, G</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$3</td>
		<td>B, C, M, P</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$4</td>
		<td>F, H, V, W, Y</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$5</td>
		<td>K</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$8</td>
		<td>J, X</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$10</td>
		<td>Q, Z</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>On top of the base revenue from each letter of the word, you earn bonus profit equivalent to the number of printed words in a row without duplicates. This resets once there is a duplicate in this chain.</p>
<p>
Example:<br><br>
["one", "two", "three"] => bonus: $3<br>
["one", "two", "three", "one"] => bonus: $1
</p>

<h3>Discover</h3>
<p>To discover a new letter, you engage with your shady dealer, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>To discover a new word, you can either form it yourself, or you form a stronger bond with the printer so that it can discover words on your behalf. As mentioned earlier, you're not able to discover a word that is longer than what the printer can print on a single piece of paper. So you definitely need to find a way to squeeze more letters into a single piece of paper.</p>
